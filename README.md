Project Name: A Chess Game

Description: A Chess Game is a classic game of chess built using the SFML library and C++ programming language. It features a 2D chessboard with pieces that can be moved by players.

The game is built using object-oriented programming principles and the SFML graphics library for rendering. The game offers three different modes: local 2-player mode, 1-player vs AI mode, and online multiplayer mode.

Features:

    Classic game of chess with 2D graphics
    Object-oriented programming design
    Local 2-player mode
  
The project is built using the SFML graphics library and the code is open-source and available on Github. It's a great example of how to use SFML to create a 2D game, and can be used as a starting point for other game development projects.
