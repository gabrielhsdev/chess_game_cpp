Project Name: A Chess Game

Description: A Chess Game is a classic game of chess built using the SFML library and C++ programming language. It features a 2D chessboard with pieces that can be moved by players.
The game is built using object-oriented programming principles and the SFML graphics library for rendering. The game offers three different modes: local 2-player mode, 1-player vs AI mode, and online multiplayer mode.

In local 2-player mode, two players can play against each other on the same device. In 1-player vs AI mode, the player can play against the computer at different levels of difficulty. In online multiplayer mode, players can play against each other over the internet.

The game stores the state of each game, allowing players to pause and resume a game at a later time. The game also features a history viewer, allowing players to review previous moves made in the current game.

Features:
-Classic game of chess with 2D graphics
-Object-oriented programming design
-Local 2-player mode
-1-player vs AI mode at different levels of difficulty
-Online multiplayer mode
-Match log viwer
  
The project is built using the SFML graphics library and the code is open-source and available on Github. It's a great example of how to use SFML to create a 2D game, and can be used as a starting point for other game development projects.

To use the project, simply download the code from Github and compile it using a C++ compiler and the SFML library. The project is licensed under the MIT License, so feel free to use it for your own game development projects.

If you have any questions or suggestions for the project, feel free to create an issue on Github or contact the project owner. Have fun playing A Chess Game!
